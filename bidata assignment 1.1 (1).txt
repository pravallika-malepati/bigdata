                     Assignment 1.1

1)various sources of big data 

A)The various sources of big data are:
  1.Social Media 
  2.Business Apps
  3.Sensor Data
  4.Media
  5.Machiene Log Data
  6.Public Web



2)3V's of Big Data.
A)3V's of big data are:
  1.Volume:Volume refers to the quantity of the data.
  2.Variety:There are three types of data
           a.Structured Data
           b.Semi-Structured Data
           c.Unstructured Data
  3.Velocity:speed at which data generates is called velocity



3)Horizantal scaling and vertical scaling.

A)1.Horizontal scaling:Horizontal scaling means enhancing the performance of server  by adding more instances of server to your pool of                                                           servers so that load can be spread.
  
  2.Vertical Scaling:It refers to the process of adding more physical resources  such as memory, storage and CPU to the existing database                                                          server for improving the performance.

4)Need and Working of Hadoop:
A)Need of Hadoop:
                It provides the best framework that helps in solving the challenges of big data.
  Working of hadoop:It is done by two major components.
                   a.HDFS:Hadoop distributed file System is used for storing the large files.
                   b.MapReduce:Map Reduce engine processes the stored data.
